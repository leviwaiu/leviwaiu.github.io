{"pageProps":{"thoughtData":{"id":"finish-website","content":"<p>This is only a test entry for the finally completed thoughts page.</p>\n<p>Despite there being many templates for much better looking and functional websites, I still insist on writing my own\nwebpage for my new website, even with the time and energy constraints I already have. The reasoning is simple: this is\nmy own first impression for many strangers that may or may not exist on the internet, and I believe that the front door\nshould be a representation of what I am as a person, as well as what I believe in.</p>\n<p>I do believe that many of the websites that are currently deployed to be painfully bloated and contains too much\nunnecessary fluff that are not essential for the website, or even essential to deliver a nice looking website. I do not\nneed an entire framework for this website strictly (though I did use one as an excuse to gain more experience in it, so\nI am kind of hypocritical in that regard), and through using a static website generator I can deliver the same website\nas many other frameworks with much less of the overhead.</p>\n<p>As such, despite there being many other, easier functions of the internet, I still wrote my own implementation and my\nown website. This is my front door, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n","title":"Why I wrote my own website.","date":"2020-11-07"}},"__N_SSG":true}
